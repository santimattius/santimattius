### Who I am

I am a system analyst, mobile developer and backend developer. In short I love writing code and even better quality code.
My areas of expertise are software architecture, testing and systems design. If I put aside the most important of my career the development of mobile applications, inspired by world-class applications and creating high-quality applications.
As a software developer I like to be constantly learning, experimenting with new technologies, and enjoying great books, making difficult ones easy.
